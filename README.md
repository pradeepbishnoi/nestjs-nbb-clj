## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.
On top of that i have added some [nbb](https://github.com/babashka/nbb) related code.

Thanks to @borkdude to help make it work.

Adding this a first commit for reference and will be refining further. Aim of this was to replace existing nest.js/typescript code with Clojure code in phased manner. So now you can write independent module/function on top of it and extend as per your need.
